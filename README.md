# AI-Powered Prediction Project README

## Introduction

This project is focused on building machine learning models to predict a specific outcome using various algorithms. The primary goal is to demonstrate the use of popular Python libraries for data manipulation, model building, and evaluation. The project uses historical datasets spanning different decades, and the predictive models are built to forecast outcomes based on features from these datasets.

## Libraries Used

The following Python libraries are used in this project:

- `numpy`: A fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
- `pandas`: A versatile data manipulation and analysis library.
- `sklearn`: Scikit-learn, a powerful library for machine learning and data mining.
  - `train_test_split`: Used for splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
  - `StandardScaler`: Used for standardizing feature values.
  - `LogisticRegression`: A linear classification algorithm.
  - `KNeighborsClassifier`: A k-nearest neighbors classification algorithm.
  - `DecisionTreeClassifier`: A decision tree-based classification algorithm.
  - `LinearSVC`: Linear Support Vector Classification.
  - `SVC`: Support Vector Classification.
  - `MLPClassifier`: Multi-layer Perceptron classifier.
  - `RandomForestClassifier`: A powerful ensemble classifier using decision trees.
  - `GradientBoostingClassifier`: Another ensemble classifier using boosting.
  
## Datasets

The project uses the following datasets:

- `dataset-of-00s.csv`
- `dataset-of-10s.csv`
- `dataset-of-60s.csv`
- `dataset-of-70s.csv`
- `dataset-of-80s.csv`
- `dataset-of-90s.csv`

Each dataset corresponds to a specific decade, and they contain relevant features for prediction.

## Workflow

1. **Data Loading**: The project starts with loading the historical datasets using pandas. This step involves reading the CSV files and creating dataframes for further processing.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Data preprocessing is a crucial step. It includes handling missing values, feature selection, and possibly feature engineering. Standardization of features is also performed using `StandardScaler` to ensure that all features have the same scale.

3. **Train-Test Split**: The preprocessed data is split into training and testing sets using `train_test_split` from scikit-learn.

4. **Model Selection**: Several classification algorithms are utilized to build predictive models. These algorithms include logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, decision trees, support vector classifiers, multi-layer perceptron, random forest, and gradient boosting.

5. **Model Training**: The training data is used to train each of the selected models.

6. **Model Evaluation**: The performance of each model is evaluated using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This step helps in identifying the best-performing model.

7. **Conclusion**: Based on the evaluation results, conclusions are drawn regarding the effectiveness of different algorithms for this prediction task.
